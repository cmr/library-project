\section{Preliminary Report}

After further meeting and consideration, our team has come to the conclusion that the majority of the
initially established directives are going to be implemented within the finished product, as they line
up directly with the needs of the Clarkson Open Source Institute. The intended feature list can be broken
into a series of use cases, as will be demonstrated below.

The first portion of the project consists of a library management system, described by the following use
cases:

\begin{itemize}
	\item As a library maintainer, I want a database of every book currently owned by the COSI library.
	\item As a library maintainer, I want to be able to restrict certain books from being checked out by students.
	\item As a library maintainer, I want to beable to keep tabsonwho has what book, and for how long.
	\item As a user of the library, I want to be capable of checking out books without needing to notify the library maintainer
	\item As a user of the library, I want to be able into check out books without requiring any non-standard identification upon loan
	\item As a user of the library, I want to be able to check out books conveniently, without having to type in book information each time I wish to check out.
	\item As a user of the library, I want like to have a web interface for keeping track of which books I currently have on loan, and which books are
available for loan.
	\item As a user of the library, I want this web interface to provide information on the books available to me.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, while not considered a requirement for completion, there are several use cases whose implementation are desirable for the labs' frequent members:

\begin{itemize}
	\item As a member of the Clarkson Open Source Institute, I want to be able to access a web service to view any recorded meetings I may have missed.
	\item As a member of the Clarkson Open Source Institute, I want to be able to view any transcripts/meeting minutes that have been written on the same page as the video.
	\item As the secretary of the Clarkson Open Source Institute, I want to have a means of uploading video recordings of the meetings, and submit accompanying transcripts/meeting minutes.
	\item As the secretary of the Clarkson Open Source Institute, I want to upload chat logs/email threads that are viewable/searchable by members of the labs.
	\item As the secretary of the Clarkson Open Source Institute, I want to be able to edit this information with a plain text editor, without needing to learn non-standard version control systems.
\end{itemize}

We are also considering the idea of using the Wiki to provide a couple of other services, but details of this have not yet been worked out.

The workload for out group is going to be divided as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Adam Kimball
		\begin{itemize}
 			\item Writing and refining the web front-end for users to access
		\end{itemize}
	\item Corey Richardson
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Construction and implementation of the scanning machine for users to manage
				book check-in/check-out
		\end{itemize}
	\item Alex Macri
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Creation and initial maintainence of the book database, and implementing
				an easy way for library maintainers to make changes to the database.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

            Currently Assigned To Book), add new copy?''.

        \item If Yes, server adds another copy of that book to the library and
            checks it out to the user.
        \item If No, prompt the user whether the book should be checked out.
            \begin{enumerate}[1.]

\section{Design Goals}

The following design goals have been identified:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Ease of adding new books to the library.} The whole purpose
        of this software system is to achieve this goal, to ensure that the
        lab's library is well maintained into the future. This leads to the
        amount of steps for adding books being as minimal as possible,
        requiring no typing and using existing bar codes.
    \item \textit{Ease of finding existing books.} The system needs to be
        applicable to more than just the library maintainer. The search and
        browsing features of the website work to accomplish this goal. It is
        conceivable that more ways of accessing this information may be
        desired in the future.
    \item \textit{High availability.} The library is used frequently and at
        all times of the day. Therefore, the library administration system
        should have minimal unscheduled downtime.
    \item \textit{Uses available computing resources in the COSI server room.}
        This is a practical non-functional requirement imposed by the client.
        The library management system should integrate with the existing
        infrastructure as much as possible, for ease of administration.
    \item \textit{Uses a comprehensible architecture for future maintainers.}
        After this system is designed and implemented, further requirements
        may come to light as the system is used and the library's needs grow.
        Further developers need to be able to understand and modify the
        system, fixing bugs and adding features as necessary.
\end{itemize}
