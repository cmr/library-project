\section{Use Cases}

%Sometimes it is a good idea to put domain objects in \texttt{}
%The template and the descriptions are based on the book Applying UML and Patterns:
%An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development
%(3rd Edition) by Craig Larman.
\begin{usecase}

\addtitle{Use Case 1}{Handle Book Checkout \texit{(Corey Richardson)}}

%Scope: the system under design
\addfield{Scope:}{Library Management System}

%Level: "user-goal" or "subfunction"
\addfield{Level:}{User-goal}

%Primary Actor: Calls on the system to deliver its services.
\addfield{Primary Actor:}{Lab Member}

%Stakeholders and Interests: Who cares about this use case and what do they want?
\additemizedfield{Stakeholders and Interests:}{
	\item Lab Member: Wants to check out books easily, using student ID card,
        and without entering book information manually.
    \item Library Manager: Wants certain books to not be checked out, and
        users to only be able to checkout a certain number of books.
}

%Preconditions: What must be true on start and worth telling the reader?
%\addfield{Preconditions:}{}
%when multiple
\additemizedfield{Preconditions:}{
    \item Lab Member must have a valid student ID.
    \item Book must be in the library (cannot check out book online).
}

%Postconditions: What must be true on successful completion and worth telling the reader
%\addfield{Postconditions:}{}
%when multiple
\additemizedfield{Postconditions:}{
    \item Book is assigned to the user.
    \item The user's quota is decremented.
    \item The book is marked as ``unavailable''.
}

%Main Success Scenario: A typical, unconditional happy path scenario of success.
\addscenario{Main Success Scenario:}{
	\item The user browses the bookshelves.
    \item The user takes the book to the scanner.
    \item \label{itm:scancommand} The user scans the ``checkout book'' command on a command sheet.
    \item \label{itm:scanid} The user scans their student ID barcode.
    \item \label{itm:scanbarcode} The user scans the book's barcode.
    \item \label{itm:happybeep} The scanner makes a ``success'' beep, indicating
        that the user has successfully checked out the book.
}

%Extensions: Alternate scenarios of success or failure.
\addscenario{Extensions:}{
    \item[\ref{itm:scancommand}.a] Invalid command:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Scanner makes a ``failure'' beep, and uses text-to-speech to
            state ``Invalid Command''.
		\item User returns to step 2 and corrects the errors
		\end{enumerate}
}

%Special Requirements: Related non-functional requirements.
\additemizedfield{Special Requirements:}{
	\item first applicable non-functional requirement
	\item second applicable non-functional requirement
}

%Technology and Data Variations List: Varying I/O methods and data formats.
\addscenario{Technology and Data Variations List:}{
	\item[1a.] Alternative first action with other technology
}

%Frequency of Occurrence: Influences investigation, testing and timing of implementation.
\addfield{Frequency of Occurrence:}{}

%Miscellaneous: Such as open issues/questions
%\addfield{Open Issues:}{}
