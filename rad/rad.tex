%Scope: the system under design
\addfield{Scope:}{Library Management System}

%Level: "user-goal" or "subfunction"
\addfield{Level:}{User-goal}

%Primary Actor: Calls on the system to deliver its services.
\addfield{Primary Actor:}{Lab Member}

%Stakeholders and Interests: Who cares about this use case and what do they want?
\additemizedfield{Stakeholders and Interests:}{
	\item Lab Member: Wants to check out books easily, using student ID card,
        and without entering book information manually.
    \item Library Maintainer: Wants certain books to not be checked out, and
        users to only be able to checkout a certain number of books.
}

%Preconditions: What must be true on start and worth telling the reader?
%\addfield{Preconditions:}{}
%when multiple
\additemizedfield{Preconditions:}{
    \item Lab Member must have a valid student ID.
    \item Book must be in the library (cannot check out book online).
    \item Library barcode scanner is present and functional.
}

%Postconditions: What must be true on successful completion and worth telling the reader
%\addfield{Postconditions:}{}
%when multiple
\additemizedfield{Postconditions:}{
    \item Book is assigned to the user.
    \item The user's quota is decremented.
    \item The book is marked as ``unavailable''.
}

%Main Success Scenario: A typical, unconditional happy path scenario of success.
\addscenario{Main Success Scenario:}{
	\item The user browses the bookshelves.
    \item The user takes the book to the scanner.
    \item \label{itm:scancommand} The user scans the ``checkout book'' command on a command sheet.
    \item \label{itm:scanid} The user scans their student ID barcode.
    \item \label{itm:scanbarcode} The user scans the book's barcode.
    \item The scanner makes a ``success'' beep, indicating
        that the user has successfully checked out the book.

\addscenario{Extensions:}{
    \item[\ref{itm:scancommand}a.] Invalid command:
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item Scanner makes a ``failure'' beep, and uses text-to-speech to
            state ``Invalid Command''.
        \item User returns to step \ref{itm:scancommand} and re-scans a
            correct command.
		\end{enumerate}

    \item[\ref{itm:scanid}a.] Unknown ID:
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item Scanner makes a ``failure'' beep, and uses text-to-speech to
            state ``Unknown ID''.
        \item User registers their ID (see ``Registration'' usecase)
        \end{enumerate}

    \item[\ref{itm:scanbarcode}a.] Unknown ISBN:
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item Scanner sends ISBN to server to register it as part of the
            library, followed by a checkout command.
        \item Server fetches the book information and adds it to the library
            database, as well as checking out that book to the user.
        \item Scanner makes a ``success'' beep.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item[\ref{itm:scanbarcode}b.] Book already checked out:
        \begin{enumerate}[1.]
        \item Scanner uses tex-to-speech to state ``Book checked out to (User
            Currently Assigned To Book), add new copy?''.
        \item User scans ``Yes'' or ``No'' command from command sheet.
        \item If Yes, server adds another copy of that book to the library and
            checks it out to the user.
        \item If No, prompt the user whether the book should be checked out.
            \begin{enumerate}[1.]
            \item If Yes, check the book out from the other user.
            \item If No, emit ``failure'' beep and use text-to-speech to state
                ``Already checked out, ask (User Currently Assigned To Book)
                to check it out''.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
}

%Special Requirements: Related non-functional requirements.
\additemizedfield{Special Requirements:}{
	\item Scanner responds within 1 second 90\% of the time.
	\item Scanner resets all commands after 1 minute of waiting for input, to
        handle users walking away.
}

%Technology and Data Variations List: Varying I/O methods and data formats.
\addscenario{Technology and Data Variations List:}{
	\item All interaction done with a barcode scanner using standard user ID
        cards and ISBN barcodes.
}

%Frequency of Occurrence: Influences investigation, testing and timing of implementation.
\addfield{Frequency of Occurrence:}{Multiple times per week.}

%Miscellaneous: Such as open issues/questions
